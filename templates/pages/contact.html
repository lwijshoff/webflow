                If you have any questions, issues, or feedback regarding this WebFlow instance, please reach out using the contact options below.
                As WebFlow is a self‑hosted platform, inquiries should be directed to your local administrator or organization managing this instance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Instance‑Specific Support</h3>
            <p>
                For questions about your account, available features, or data management, please contact the local administrator of this WebFlow installation.
                Each instance operates independently, so administrators are best equipped to assist with configuration or technical matters.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Reporting Issues</h3>
            <p>
                If you encounter technical errors, login problems, or unexpected behavior, you can submit a report directly to your administrator.
                Providing details such as your role, the page where the issue occurred, and the steps leading to it can help resolve the problem faster.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">General Inquiries</h3>
            <p>
                For questions about WebFlow as a software project, feature suggestions, or development contributions,
                visit the official project page or repository where WebFlow is maintained.
                The software provider does not manage individual self‑hosted instances or user accounts.
