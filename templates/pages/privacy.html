            <p class="lead">
                Your privacy is important. This policy explains how information may be collected, stored, and used within WebFlow.
                Because WebFlow is a self‑hosted platform, each organization or administrator running an instance is responsible for managing its own data and user information.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Information Collected</h3>
            <p>
                WebFlow may store basic user details such as names, email addresses, roles, and any data entered through custom pages or modules.
                Since WebFlow allows administrators to create custom functionality, the type of data collected can vary depending on how the local instance is configured.
                Each organization hosting its own WebFlow installation determines what information is collected and how it is used.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Use of Information</h3>
            <p>
                The information entered into WebFlow is processed to enable platform functionality, authentication, and communication between roles.
                WebFlow itself does not transmit or share data externally beyond the self‑hosted environment unless configured by the local administrator.
                Any integration with external systems or third‑party tools is managed solely by the organization hosting the instance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Data Security</h3>
            <p>
                Security of data depends on the configuration and maintenance of the self‑hosted instance.
                Administrators are encouraged to apply proper access controls, encryption, and secure server practices to protect user information against unauthorized access or loss.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">User Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                Users and administrators who create custom content, forms, or modules are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws and internal policies.
                WebFlow provides the tools to build and manage custom features; however, the handling of personal data within those features remains the responsibility of the instance owner.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data.
                To exercise these rights or raise any privacy concern, please contact this site's local administrator.
                WebFlow as a software provider does not have access to, or control over, self‑hosted user data.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Policy Updates</h3>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy template may be updated periodically to reflect best practices or new regulations.
                Individual instances may also provide additional local privacy notices as required by their organization or region.
