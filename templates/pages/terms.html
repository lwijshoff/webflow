            <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold mb-3">Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                These Terms of Service outline the general conditions for using WebFlow and any self‑hosted instances based on it.
                By accessing or using a WebFlow installation, you agree to comply with these terms and any additional local rules set by the administrator of this instance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">1. Use of the Platform</h3>
            <p>
                WebFlow is a flexible platform that allows administrators to build and manage custom web applications.
                Users are expected to use the platform responsibly and only for lawful purposes.
                Any misuse, unauthorized access, or interference with the functionality of this WebFlow instance is strictly prohibited.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">2. Local Administration Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                Each organization or individual hosting a WebFlow instance is solely responsible for managing its configuration, data, and user access.
                The administrators of a local installation determine the features available, user permissions, and any integrations with external systems.
                WebFlow as a software provider has no control over, or responsibility for, how individual instances are operated or what content they host.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">3. User Accounts</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on configuration, users may need to create an account to access certain features.
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities performed under your account.
                Administrators of this instance reserve the right to suspend or remove accounts that violate these terms or local policies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">4. Custom Content and Modules</h3>
            <p>
                WebFlow allows administrators and developers to create custom pages, tools, and extensions.
                The organization or user who creates and manages such custom content is solely responsible for its accuracy, security, and compliance with applicable laws.
                WebFlow does not endorse or monitor third‑party or user‑generated features within self‑hosted instances.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">5. Data Ownership and Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                All data stored within a self‑hosted WebFlow instance belongs to the organization or administrator managing it.
                The handling of that data, including collection, processing, and removal, is subject to local privacy practices defined by the instance owner.
                WebFlow as a software provider does not access, process, or store any user data from self‑hosted deployments.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>
                WebFlow is provided on an “as‑is” basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.
                The software developer and contributors are not responsible for any damages or data loss resulting from the use or misuse of WebFlow or any derivative works.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>
                In no event shall the creators or contributors of WebFlow be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of this platform.
                Responsibility for safe and compliant operation rests entirely with the organization hosting the self‑hosted instance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">8. Modifications</h3>
            <p>
                These terms may be updated over time to reflect changes to the software or best practices.
                Local administrators may also define additional usage rules for their instance.
                It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically. Continued use of this instance constitutes acceptance of any updates.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4 fw-bold">9. Contact</h3>
            <p>
